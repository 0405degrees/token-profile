          "en": "Harmony Block Capital is a tokenized crypto hedge fund and a distributed autonomous fund with a distributed autonomous organizational structure. The fund uses tokens and smart contracts to participate in financial management. The fund's position information, transaction record, portfolio and asset curve are all integrated in the crypto audit system, open and transparent to the query and supervision of the fund holders and the public, and the fund's assets will be recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. The fund holders can participate in the management through the general meeting of the holders according to their TRUST shares (1 TRUST represents 1 voting right and 1 fund share), so as to maximize the autonomy.TRUST token is a tokenized fund share, which is a negotiable proof of community governance and rights. It is used for fund profit distribution, unit net value calculation, share transfer and circulation, community governance and fund operation cost settlement.TRUST does not belong to ICO, because TRUST is issued by pledge ETH at the time of subscription, and is exchanged and circulated with ETH through subscription pledge and redemption, and TRUST anchors fund performance against ETH price.",
